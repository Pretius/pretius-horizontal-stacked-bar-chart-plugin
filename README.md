## JSON Data Format

The plugin expects the chart data to be in the following JSON format:

```JSON
{
  "records": [
    {
      "label": "Segment 1",
      "value": 30,
      "style": "#FF0000"
    },
    {
      "label": "Segment 2",
      "value": 50,
      "style": "#00FF00"
    },
    {
      "label": "Segment 3",
      "value": 20,
      "style": "#0000FF"
    }
  ]
}
```

*   `label`: The label for the segment (string).
*   `value`: The value of the segment (number).
*   `style`: The style of the segment (string). This can be a color hex code, a CSS class, or any other valid CSS style.

## Example

Here's an example of how to use the plugin with a SQL query:

```SQL
SELECT d.deptno,
       d.dname,
       /* Start of JSON */
        (SELECT 
            JSON_OBJECT(
                'records' VALUE 
                    JSON_ARRAYAGG(
                        JSON_OBJECT(
                            'label' VALUE e.job, -- Label
                            'value' VALUE COUNT(*), -- value
                            'style' VALUE CASE e.job -- Optional Styling
                                WHEN 'MANAGER' THEN 'u-warning-bg' 
                                WHEN 'CLERK' THEN 'u-info-bg'
                                ELSE 'u-danger-bg' END
                        )
                        ORDER BY e.job -- Order by Label
                    )
            ) AS chart_data 
        FROM emp e -- Child Table
        WHERE e.deptno = d.deptno -- Join to the Parent Table
        GROUP BY e.job) chart_data
        /* End  of JSON */
  FROM dept d -- Parent Table
 ORDER BY dname
```

1.  Create an Interactive Report region.
2.  Set the source of the Interactive Report to the above SQL query.
3.  Set the "Chart Data JSON Column" attribute of the Pretius Horizontal Stacked Bar Chart plugin to `CHART_DATA`.
4. Run the Page

## With/Apply Method

 SHOW_PERCENTAGES:=Y
 SHOW_VALUES:=Y
 SHOW_TOOLTIPS:=Y
 HEIGHT:=40px
 MIN_WIDTH:=auto
